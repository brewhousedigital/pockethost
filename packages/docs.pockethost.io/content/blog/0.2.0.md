The fully managed PocketBase hosting service https://pockethost.io has been updated to v0.2.0. Go check it out and spin up your very own PocketBase instance ðŸš€

This release is [fully Dockerized](https://github.com/benallfree/pockethost/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yaml).

v0.2.0 scales much better than v0.0.1 by using a [dynamic proxy approach](https://github.com/benallfree/pockethost/blob/master/packages/daemon/src/ProxyServer.ts#L40). In the previous version, PocketBase instances stayed running and eventually crashed ðŸ”¥ the server due to memory constraints. In this version, the proxy launches your PocketBase instance just-in-time when a request comes in. After a period of inactivity, your PocketBase instance will be [shut down until a new request comes in](https://github.com/benallfree/pockethost/blob/master/packages/daemon/src/InstanceManager.ts#L148). The "first hit" cost of launching your PocketBase instance from a cold start seems to take <500ms, so it's almost not noticeable under normal application use.

I also upgraded the server to 4GB RAM and 2 CPUs, so there should be plenty of room to play around.

At some point down the road, we may accept fly.io machine keys and use fly.io's "machine proxy" service to spin up your instances on-demand. At that point, there won't be shared tenancy anymore.

But I think shared tenancy does have a place in this space. There is something very nice and easy about logging in to pockethost.io and having an instantly configured backend including email and S3, and maybe some day Litestream too. That combined with the upcoming [PBScript](https://github.com/benallfree/pbscript) release and pockethost integration gives you a powerful BaaS without ever going near servers, re-compiling anything, deploying architecture-specific binaries, or needing to manage hosting provider API keys. You literally just get a pockethost URL like [https://harvest.pockethost.io/\_](https://harvest.pockethost.io/_), feed it to your client SDK, and go.

@brewhousedigital generously offered to take a look at the SvelteKit UI for pockethost and might spruce it up a bit. My design skills are lacking and I'm very aware ðŸ™ˆ
