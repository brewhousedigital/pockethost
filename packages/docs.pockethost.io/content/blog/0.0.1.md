I have an alpha up at https://pockethost.io.

- Running on a single Digital Ocean VPS
- Frontend is Svelte plus a pocketbase backend (the mothership)
- VPS has a daemon running that listens to new records from the main pocketbase instance. When it finds a new record, it provisions an SSL cert, updates nginx, creates a data storage location, finds a free port, and spawns a new pocketbase instance dedicated to the new entry. If anything ever crashes, this daemon will re-spawn all pocketbase instances at startup
- I keep an internal table (admin only) of instance info including health, uptime, port number, and other goodies
- Each pocketbase instance gets its own subdomain

Still to do:

- Is there a way to preconfigure the pocketbase instance with the correct Application URL?
- Is there a way to preconfigure the instance with a `<subdomain>@pockethost.io` email address? I have Amazon SES approved.
- It might make sense to shut down idle instances after 7 days or something. Waiting for a problem first.
- Still interested in a multitenant scenario where a single pocketbase instance can handle requests based on an `X-PocketBase-Tenant` header or something

@ganigeorgiev Let me know what you think. Also, if the PocketHost name is too close to PocketBase please tell me and I'll change it.
