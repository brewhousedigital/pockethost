description: Cloud functions (pb_hooks support), many fixes and chores

---

[PocketHost](https://pockethost.io) is the zero-config 'PocketBase in the cloud' platform. Thank you for everyone's continued support for this project.

## What's New

This is the last major release before v1.0. At v1.0, a paid tier will likely be introduced.

Highlights in this release:

- Added `pb_hooks` cloud function support
- Removed Deno-based cloud workers in favor of `pb_hooks` JS hooks
- Improved logging - `console.log` in JS hooks now appears in logs
- Improved secrets - secrets are now passed to `pocketbase` executable and are available in JS hooks
- Security - All `pocketbase` instances now run in Docker sandboxes in isolated environments. Reduces security risks and bad neighbor effects.
- Started using `pb_hooks` internally to replace some complex listener logic
